Port bugs:
    - Over reimplement inventory.
    - Machine blocks render incorrectly in hand.
    - Machine blocks have incorrect light in GUI?
    - Fix particle accelerator not consuming items when accelerating.

Known bugs:
    Before Beta release:
        - Make sure that block is dropped when destroyed in survival mode.
        - Handle inventory on destruction of block, drop in world or preserve in item block. (MOSTLY DONE, REVIEW...
        - JEI integration.
        - When other mods fluids is used as default, tanks still contain the old one. (SEEMS TO BE FORGE BEHAVIOUR, NOT A BUG)

        - Fix fissile rod stack inserting ghost stack into reactor cell.

    Low Priority:
        - Store fluids in NBT on machine drop?
        - Add subtitle to sounds.
        - Verify that all sounds is more streamlined.
        - Implement support for other mods wrenches. (DONE: Mekanism)
        - Check if we should have a uranium hexaflouride container for gas centrifuge and nuclear boiler.
        - Implement inventory automation for all machines. (NOT NECESSARY?)

    High Priority:
        - Reactors are only running when first opening GUI on world load. (NOT CONFIRMED)
        - Verify the breeding process.
            - Should breeding reactors only create heat when actually enriched uranium is present in the middle?

        - Fix electric turbine sound, for both small and large.
        - Fix strange Celsius character. (NOT A PROBLEM ANYMORE)?
        - Empty cell having NBT when filled and later emptied.
        - Check if more turbines is more efficient than one.
        - Add a delay to thermometer redstone output, so that it stays in it current state for a period of time.

Known features not implemented:

New features to add:
    Convenience:
        - Add electromagnetic cell, a cell capable of holding antimatter?
        - Implement IAntiPoisonBlock and add make radiation resistant blocks. (Raytrace).

    Enhancement:
        - Make toxic waste spawn when reactor melts down, based on toxic waste amount in the reactor.
        - Make reactor make glass if sand is next to it.
        - Make accelerator GUI show energy usage per 5 mg antimatter, as a measure of efficiency.
        - Make it more toxic to carry larger quantities of radioactive material. Like a whole stack of uranium.
        - Add support for vertical particle accelerators.

        - Add a Geiger counter to measure radiation.
        - Add radiation resistance block which implements IAntiPoisonBlock. See EntityLivingBase.canEntityBeSeen()

        - Amplify sirens, with sort of multi block structure, also add pitch support for the multi block.
        - Add metal break sound to machines etc?
        - Add thorium fuel?
        - Add plasma decay event?
        - Add auto update support (https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/autoupdate/)
        - Add thermal capability that can be applied to tile entities.
        - Use mekanism better performance redstone checks?
        - Make boiling water spawn particle rate based in the temperature. (https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/17620/equation-to-make-small-number-big-and-big-number-small-gravity)
        - Make tritium emit light when in a container.
        - Add ghost item support to quantum assembler.
        - Add pill that cures radiation poisoning, use function setCurativeItems() on potion effect to do that.
        - Add Mekanism recipes? NuclearCraft recipes? IC2 recipes?

    Rendering:
        - Render only moving parts in TESR's?

    Networking:
        - Optimize syncing of machines etc, only sync when gui is open etc.

    Energy:
        Chemical Extractor: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 RF = 27 Yellowcake (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Gas Centrifuge: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 2 Refined/Breading Uranium

        Nuclear Boiler: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 8 Yellowcake creates 3200 L Uranium Hexaflouride (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Particle Accelerator: (DONE)
            5 mg antimatter (One particle accelerated to 100%) uses 97.85 MJ if inner circle is 100x100 blocks.

        Plasma Heater: (DONE)
            4 x 128MJ ~= 80000 = 2000 mB

        Quantum Assembler: (DONE)
            Per item = ((2 x 47) * 128MJ) - 22 MJ = (94 * 128 MJ) - 22 MJ = 12010 MJ (4804 RF?)

        Fulmination Generator: (TODO)
            125mg antimatter = 24.93 MJ
            1g antimatter = ?
